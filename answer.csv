1, The fundamental theorem of calculus states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a; b] and F is an antiderivative of the function f in that interval then the definite integral of f over [a; b] is equal to F(b) - F(a).
2, Integration in calculus involves finding the integral of a function which represents the accumulation of quantities.
